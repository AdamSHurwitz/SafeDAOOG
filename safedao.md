## Incorporation

*SafeDAO and Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF) are separate entities.*

### Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF)

- About
    - SEF is a [Swiss non-profit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tSayb53cQJZd8uldNmtQv_R5PiKrU_6JfFRoL36xgR4/edit#heading=h.wkghaki8zg6k)
    - Incorporation filing: [Safe Ã–kosystem Stiftung](https://stiftungen.stiftungschweiz.ch/organisation/safe-oekosystem-stiftung)
    - A Swiss Foundation acts similar to a smart contract in that the rules to follow must be clearly defined or else liable under Swiss law.
- Committees
    - The foundation can create community-elected committees, e.g. Grants
    - The foundation's board has veto power.
- Personal liabilities
    - Board members have full personal liability.
    - Regular participating members have limited personal liability.

### Future potential SafeDAO <> SEF relationship

- SafeDAO becomes a primary governance body of SEF
    - Potentially formed through a foundation committee composed of SafeDAO members.
    - Governance, e.g. Electing the board
    - Mandates
    - Budgets
    - Guidelines/processes
- Timeline: Can take 1-2 years
