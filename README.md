# ðŸ”° SafeDAO open info

The SafeDAO is a community of builders, users, and contributers that coordinate the development of the Safe ecosystem.  The Safe ecosystem brings digital ownership to everyone by building a universal and open smart contract standard for the custody of digital assets, data, and identity with the Safe ecosystem.

Open information (OI) expands the ability for communities to collaborate. OI includes relevant documentation by protocol teams, outside resources, and context.
